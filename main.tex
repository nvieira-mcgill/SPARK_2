\begin{abstract}
In kilonovae, freshly-synthesized $r$-process elements imprint features on optical spectra, as observed in AT2017gfo, the counterpart to the GW170817 binary neutron star merger. However, measuring the $r$-process compositions of the merger ejecta is computationally challenging. \cite{vieira23} introduced Spectroscopic $r$-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (\SPARK), a software tool to infer elemental abundance patterns of the ejecta, and associate spectral features with particular species. Previously, we applied \SPARK~to the 1.4 day spectrum of AT2017gfo and inferred its abundance pattern for the first time, characterized by electron fraction $Y_e=0.31$, a substantial abundance of strontium, and a dearth of lanthanides and heavier elements. This ejecta is consistent with wind from a remnant hypermassive neutron star and/or accretion disk. We now extend our inference to spectra at 2.4 and 3.4 days, and test the need for multi-component ejecta, where we stratify the ejecta in composition. The ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days is described by the same single blue component. At 3.4 days, a new redder component with lower $Y_e=0.16$ and a significant abundance of lanthanides emerges. This new redder component is consistent with dynamical ejecta and/or neutron-rich ejecta from a magnetized accretion disk. As expected from photometric modelling, this component emerges as the ejecta expands, the photosphere recedes, and the earlier bluer component dims. At 3.4 days, we find an ensemble of lanthanides, with the presence of cerium most concrete. This presence of lanthanides has important implications for the contribution of kilonovae to the $r$-process abundances observed in the Universe.

%% INTRODUCTION %%
\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Approximately half of the elements in the Universe heavier than iron are synthesized by rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis: the $r$-process (see \citealt{cowan21} for a review). Extreme astrophysical environments---namely, mergers of neutron stars (NS-NS) or a neutron star and black hole (NS-BH) and other proposed sources like collapsars or magnetorotational supernovae---offer leading candidate sites for this $r$-process nucleosynthesis due to their exceptionally high densities of free neutrons (\citealt{lattimer74, symbalisty82, eichler89, freiburghaus99, goriely11, korobkin12, bauswein13}). However, it is still unclear which of these channels dominates. The NS-NS merger GW170817, first detected in gravitational waves and then across the electromagnetic spectrum (\citealt{abbottLIGO17a, abbottLIGO17b}), has provided some insight. Both photometry (\citealt{andreoni17, arcavi17, coulter17, diaz17, drout17, evans17, hu17, kasliwal17, lipunov17, tanvir17, troja17, utsumi17, valenti17})\footnote{See \cite{villar17} for a compilation of this photometry considering inter-instrument variation.} and spectroscopy (\citealt{chornock17, kasen17, pian17, shappee17, smartt17}) of the optical/near-infrared counterpart, AT2017gfo, matched theoretical expectations for a kilonova: an explosive transient event powered by radioactive decay of freshly-synthesized $r$-process elements. However, we do not yet know the precise abundance pattern of the $r$-process elements in the ejecta, nor whether GW170817-like kilonovae could yield the $r$-process abundances seen across the Universe (\citealt{ji19, cowan21}).

The spectra of kilonovae in particular are marked by absorption and emission features from a suite of $r$-process elements, and are key for determining the detailed composition of the merger ejecta. Insights gained from spectra are independent of and complementary to light curve modelling, which has served mostly to infer macroscopic properties of the kilonova such as the heating rates, total ejecta masses, average ejecta velocities, and temperatures of the ejecta (\eg, \citealt{villar17, almualla21, breschi21, ristic22}). By modelling the spectra, we can directly infer the abundances and the conditions of $r$-process nucleosynthesis. These insights further allow us to assess the importance of mergers versus other proposed sites as the source of these elements, and, the physical ejection mechanisms at play during these mergers. 

Spectral modelling has already provided evidence that the GW170817 kilonova ejecta contained $r$-process elements, and, has enabled associations of certain absorption and/or emission features with individual species. \cite{watson19} analyzed the early time, optically thick spectra of AT2017gfo, and found the imprint of a P Cygni feature arising from \ion{Sr}{2} (strontium, ${}_{38}$Sr) at $\sim$8000~\AA, at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days post-merger. \cite{domoto21, domoto22} similarly ascribe this feature to \ion{Sr}{2}, and find tentative evidence for doubly-ionized lanthanides \ion{La}{3} and \ion{Ce}{3} (lanthanum, ${}_{57}$La and cerium, ${}_{58}$Ce) in the near-infrared ($\sim$12,000-14,000 \AA). Similarly, \cite{gillanders22} argues for the presence of \ion{Sr}{2}, but also ions of adjacent first $r$-process peak elements \ion{Y}{2} and \ion{Zr}{2} (yttrium, ${}_{39}$Y and zirconium, ${}_{39}$Zr) at wavelengths $\lesssim$ 6000 \AA. \cite{sneppenwatson23} find that \ion{Y}{2} is present at 4.4 and 5.4 days, producing a P Cygni feature at $\sim$7600~\AA. \cite{gillanders22} also suggests the presence of a modest amount of lanthanide material at these times.  At later times, when the ejecta enters an optically thin regime, the spectrum is dominated by emission features. \cite{gillanders23} find that \ion{Ce}{3} may produce emission at $\sim$15,800~\AA~and $\sim$20,700~\AA~beyond 3.4 days, up to 10.4 days. At $\gtrsim$ 7 days, these may instead arise from intrinsically weak lines, with ions \ion{Te}{3} and \ion{Te}{1} (tellurium, ${}_{52}$Te) and \ion{I}{2} (iodine, ${}_{53}$I) given as the most likely candidates (\citealt{gillanders23, hotokezaka23}). 

While these studies have shed valuable light on some of the species present in the ejecta of AT2017gfo, the abundances of \textit{all} elements in the ejecta are not known. In \cite{vieira23} (hereafter \V23), we fit the spectrum of AT2017gfo at 1.4 days post-merger, using our inference approach and software tool Spectroscopic $r$-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (\SPARK). With \SPARK, we inferred the complete elemental abundance pattern of the ejecta. We found that the ejecta was dominated by lighter $r$-process elements, generating a bluer (relatively lower opacity in the UV and optical) kilonova. This ejecta had electron fraction $Y_e = 0.311^{+0.013}_{-0.011}$ and specific entropy per nucleon $s / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 13.6^{+4.1}_{-3.0}$, which yielded an extremely low lanthanide fraction $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan}} = {-7.03}^{+0.46}_{-0.47}$. This lanthanide fraction is inconsistent with the $r$-process abundance pattern seen in the Solar system and beyond (\citealt{ji19}). 

We have not yet inferred the abundances at later epochs: 2.4 days, 3.4 days, and beyond. At later epochs, as the kilonova ejecta expands and becomes more optically thin, we expect that the photosphere recedes into the ejecta. This may uncover additional components which power the kilonova at later times, after being physically hidden underneath the photosphere at early times and/or out-shined by the early blue emission. The emergence of new components at later times would be consistent with results from light curve modeling (\eg, \citealt{villar17}), which has indicated the presence of multiple ejecta components; in particular, a redder component emerging at $\sim$3 days post-merger. These different components may originate from different ejection mechanisms during the merger, and are characterized by different masses, velocities, and heating rates as a function of time. In a NS-NS merger, we expect a redder component mostly confined to the plane of the initial binary from the tidal ejecta, with little neutrino reprocessing, a bluer squeezed polar component from the collisional interface between the two NSs, and a more isotropic red/blue disk wind from an accretion disk around a merger remnant. Our inferred $Y_e$ and $s$ at 1.4 days are consistent with an outflow produced over timescales longer than the dynamical time which has been substantially reprocessed by neutrinos, \eg, winds from a hypermassive neutron star remnant or an accretion disk. At later times, the spectrum might be dominated or better described by a different ejecta or a multi-component ejecta configuration. 

Here, we explore the time evolution of the inferred abundance pattern and the need for multi-component ejecta models to fit the spectra of AT2017gfo, at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days post-merger. We first extend our single-component fitting to 2.4 and 3.4 days to obtain the best single-component models for the ejecta. We then develop a model in the radiative transfer code where the ejecta is stratified and multi-component. We compare our best multi-component fits at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days to their single-component equivalents. The abundances of these single- and multi-component models are then examined to paint a picture of the inferred abundance pattern as a function of time. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:methods}, we briefly review \SPARK~and present the upgrades which enable fitting the later epochs of AT2017gfo with both single- and multi-component models. In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we present our fits. In Section~\ref{sec:disco}, we explore the time evolution of the inferred abundance pattern, the species present in the ejecta, and the physical origin of different components. We briefly conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conco}.

%%% subsection 2.1: SPARK OVERVIEW
\subsection{Spectroscopic $r$-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae (\textsc{SPARK})}\label{ssc:spark-summary}

We briefly describe our tool, \SPARK, and refer the reader to \V23 for more detail. \SPARK~(Spectroscopic $r$-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae) is designed as a modular inference engine for extracting key kilonova parameters from optical spectra, determining the element-by-element abundance pattern of the ejecta, and associating absorption features in the spectra with particular species. 

In \SPARK, we use the 1D \TARDIS~(\citealt{kerzendorf14, kerzendorf23})~radiative transfer code to generate a set of synthetic spectra. In \TARDIS, photon packets are propagated through shell(s) of plasma, where they may undergo either bound-bound processes or electron scattering. To handle bound-bound (matter-radiation) interactions in the ejecta, we require a list of lines for the species in the ejecta. We use a line list of observed lines, obtained through the Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD; \citealt{ryabchikova15, pakhomov19}). Each spectrum is parameterized by a set $\theta_i$ of parameters, including a luminosity, density, inner/outer computational boundary velocities, and three key parameters which set the abundances in the ejecta: the electron fraction $Y_e$, expansion velocity $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, and specific entropy per nucleon $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}$. These latter three parameters describe different abundance patterns output by the nuclear reaction network calculations of \cite{wanajo18}, which use parametric outflow trajectories, allowing us to infer the abundance pattern of the ejecta.  

To perform this inference, we express our likelihood function using the full formalism of \cite{czekala15} for likelihoods involving spectroscopic data. However, because of the considerable computational cost of spectral synthesis with \TARDIS, we do not use more common methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or nested sampling for inference---rather, we couple \TARDIS~to the approximate posterior estimation scheme of \approxposterior~(\citealt{fleming18,fleming20}). In this scheme, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate for the posterior $L_p (\theta)$ and employ Bayesian Active Posterior Estimation (BAPE; \citealt{kandasamy17}). BAPE is a form of active learning in which we maximize an acquisition function with terms including both the mean $\mu(\theta)$ and variance $\sigma^2(\theta)$ of the GP. This acquisition function thus balances exploration (of the parameter space) and exploitation (sampling around the peak(s) of the posterior). The GP is iteratively retrained as new points $(\theta, L_p(\theta))$ are added to a training set, and this GP converges to an approximation of the posterior. 

In all, inference is dramatically accelerated, and we obtain (among the other parameters) the $Y_e$, $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, and $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}$ which best describe the ejecta, with relatively few forward model evaluations. In \V23, we fit the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of AT2017fgfo (\citealt{pian17, smartt17}) at 1.4 days with a base set of 1500 Latin Hypercube samples + 1140 BAPE active learning samples. This is a factor of $\sim 10^3$ fewer samples than might be required with a standard MCMC for a similar 6-dimensional fit. 




%%% subsection 2.2: MULTI-COMPONENT EJECTA
\subsection{Multi-component, stratified ejecta with \textsc{TARDIS}}\label{ssc:multi-component-TARDIS}

In \V23, we modeled the kilonova ejecta as a single shell with a uniform abundance pattern. The plasma in this shell is also described by a single temperature and mass/electron density. This configuration is fully described by the luminosity at the outer boundary $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$, (which in fact sets the initial guess for the temperature at the inner boundary), the normalization in the density power law $\rho_0$, the inner and outer boundary velocities $v_{\mathrm{inner}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$\footnote{\TARDIS~assumes homologous expansion, in which $v \propto r$, such that velocity can be understood as a spatial coordinate. Given 
a density profile, the velocity range sets the mass of the ejecta.}, and three parameters which set the abundance pattern: electron fraction $Y_e$, expansion velocity $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, and specific entropy $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}$. A single-component fit is thus 7-dimensional, unless one or more of the parameters are fixed. For example, we fixed $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.35c$ in our fit to the 1.4 day spectrum. This setup can describe a single ejecta component such as dynamical ejecta or some outflow. It may also describe a kilonova in which one component significantly dominates (by mass or by the strength of the absorption/emission features) over the other(s). 
    
Here, we implement multi-component ejecta. \TARDIS~allows for ejecta composed of stratified radial shells, each with a specific temperature, density, plasma conditions, and composition. In this configuration, each shell can have a specific abundance pattern. In single-shell runs, we compute the plasma state only once given $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$. For these multi-shell runs, we must employ multiple \TARDIS~iterations when generating synthetic spectra. At each iteration, the plasma conditions are updated, and converge towards an ejecta where the luminosity emitted at the outer boundary matches the user-requested $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$. We use 10 such shells and 30 such iterations in all runs.
    
We begin with a simple two-component ejecta. As with our single-component model, this two-component model has an outer boundary luminosity $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$ and density $\rho_0$. Each of the components is then described by inner and outer boundary velocity ($v_{\mathrm{inner}}$ and $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$) and a $Y_e$, $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, and $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}$. Two-component fits are thus $2 + 5 + 5 = 12$-dimensional. The two components necessarily overlap in physical space because \TARDIS~cannot simulate a gap between them. The abundance in each shell is then determined by the component(s) which are in a given shell. For shells where there is overlap between two components, the abundance is taken as a sum of the two abundance patterns and renormalized to unity. 

Multiple components allow for additional complexity in the spectral synthesis.\footnote{See \cite{kawaguchi20} for an exploration of the diversity of kilonovae which may be produced when multiple components are present.} In particular, we can produce the effect of reprocessing, where emission from one component is absorbed and re-emitted/scattered by another. We can also produce the effect of lanthanide curtaining, in which some outer lower-$Y_e$ ejecta containing the lanthanides masks an inner, bluer, lighter-element ejecta, generating a redder kilonova due to the considerable opacity of the lanthanides in the near-UV and optical. Some kilonova spectra may be better-described by these multi-component ejecta models. In \V23, we find that the 1.4 day of AT2017gfo is well-described by a single-component ejecta with $Y_e = 0.31$. However, at later epochs, as the ejecta expands and becomes more optically thin, the photosphere recedes into the ejecta and we may unmask additional components which were hidden or out-shined at early times. Light curve modelling (\eg, \citealt{villar17}) has shown that the kilonova may indeed be better-described by multiple components of different opacities, and some spectral modelling (\eg, \citealt{kasen17}) also invokes multiple components. This motivates our introduction of multi-component ejecta into \SPARK.




%%% subsection 2.3: INFERENCE SETUP
\subsection{Inference setup}\label{ssc:inference-setup}

All \texttt{approxposterior}/BAPE hyperparameters and optimizers used in this work are the same as those used in \V23. We again produce a base set of $m_{0} = 1500$ Latin Hypercube sampled points at the beginning of each \SPARK~run. However, the parameter space allowed by our priors differs for the 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 day fits. Table~\ref{tab:priors-single} includes our (all uniform) priors for each of our single-component fits. The bounds on the density $\rho_0$ and abundance-setting parameters $Y_e$, $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, and $s$ are the same at all epochs. The priors differ in the bounds on the luminosity, as expected given the cooling of the ejecta over time as it expands. We further allow for wider priors on the inner and outer boundary velocities for the fits at later epochs. In \V23, we fixed $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.35c$ during our 1.4 day fit but noted that we observed similar results for $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$ in the range $0.35 - 0.38c$. Here, we allow for greater flexibility in $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$ later epochs.
    
Our priors for our multi-component fits are given in Table~\ref{tab:priors-multi}. These are broad, and identical, at 1.4 and 2.4 days. Aside from requiring $v_{\mathrm{inner,i}} < v_{\mathrm{outer,i}}$, our priors also require some overlap between the two components, \ie, $v_{\mathrm{outer},2} > v_{\mathrm{inner},1}$ or $v_{\mathrm{outer},1} > v_{\mathrm{inner},2}$. To allow for even sampling of parameter space for the $m_0 = 1500$ points in the base training set with these conditional constraints, we use constrained Latin Hypercube Sampling (\citealt{petelet09}). At 3.4 days, we encounter challenges with the convergence of the posterior for these broad, conditional priors in velocities. We thus use tighter priors on the velocities at this epoch, but all other priors are the same as those at 1.4 and 2.4 days.
    
When attempting to fit the full 3.4 day spectrum, we find that the fit converges to a blackbody with little to no absorption to fit the continuum of the spectrum, especially at the shortest wavelengths $\lesssim$6400~\AA. Since we are interested in determining the species involved in the absorption, and especially the prominent feature at $\sim$8000~\AA, we prioritize fitting the $\geqslant$6400~\AA~region of the spectrum by excluding shorter wavelengths in the computation of the likelihood. We perform this exclusion for both single- and multi-component fits.

Finally, when expressing the likelihood using the \cite{czekala15} formalism, we use a global covariance term with amplitude $a_{\mathrm{G}} = 10^{-34}~(\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$~\text{\AA}${}^{-1})^{2}$ and a correlation length scale $\ell = 0.025c$ for all 1.4 and 2.4 day fits. For 3.4 day fits, after some trial and error, we find that a smaller $a_{\mathrm{G}} = 10^{-35}~(\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$~\text{\AA}${}^{-1})^{2}$ better matches the uncertainties on the observed spectrum at this epoch.

We model the 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 day spectra of AT2017gfo with both single- and multi-component (2-component) models, and compare the results at each epoch. In Figure~\ref{fig:bestfits}, we compile our best fit spectra, and highlight our favored models. The parameters for our best fit single- and multi-component models are included in Tables~\ref{tab:bestfit_single}~and~\ref{tab:bestfit_multi}, respectively. We find that a single-component blue ejecta model best describes the 1.4 and 2.4 day spectra. At 3.4 days, we require an additional red, lanthanide-rich component in a multi-component ejecta configuration. In the following sections, we present and examine each of the best fits in turn, at each epoch. 

Appendix~\ref{app:allspec_posteriors} contains compilations of all $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}}$ spectra generated in a given \SPARK~run, for the 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 day single- and multi-component runs. Posteriors generated by the single- and multi-component runs are also included. Unless stated otherwise, we use the median and 2.5\% / 97.5\% quantiles of the posterior, or the median and these quantiles of some mode of a multi-modal posterior, to determine our best fit and uncertainties. All posteriors converge with sufficient $m_{\mathrm{active}}$ active learning samples, according to the $z$ convergence diagnostic given in \cite{fleming20}.




%%% subsection 3.1: 1.4 DAYS
\subsection{Single-and multi-component modelling at 1.4 days}\label{ssc:1.4}

In \V23, we fit the 1.4 day spectrum of AT2017gfo with a single-component ejecta model. This fit required $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 1140$ points to obtain a good fit and converged posterior (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_single}). We describe the best fit ``purple + warm'' model here, and refer the reader to \V23 for details. The purple + warm model is characterized by a photospheric velocity of $v_{\mathrm{inner}}/c = 0.313^{+0.013}_{-0.014}$; while the outer boundary velocity was fixed to $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.35c$. For abundance-setting parameters, we found an electron fraction $Y_e = 0.311^{+0.013}_{-0.011}$, expansion velocity of $v_{\mathrm{exp}}/c = 0.240^{+0.055}_{-0.082}$, and entropy of $s / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 13.6^{+4.1}_{-3.0}$. In \V23, we referred to this model as ``purple + warm'', but emphasize that this is nonetheless substantially blue ejecta within the broader context of kilonova components. These parameters correspond to an abundance pattern that is poor in lanthanides, but rich in strontium (${}_{38}$Sr), allowing for a good fit to the prominent $\sim$8000~\AA~feature. The fit struggled at shorter wavelengths: over $3500-4500$~\AA, we overestimated the absorption from yttrium (${}_{39}$Y) and zirconium (${}_{40}$Zr), while at $\lesssim$3500~\AA, we underestimated. Nonetheless, the single-component model remains our preferred model at 1.4 days, as we elaborate on below.

In our 1.4 day multi-component \SPARK~run, we require $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 1440$ points to obtain a good fit and converged posterior (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_multi}). More active learning samples are required than for single-component due to the increased dimensionality of the multi-component fits. The resultant fit generally captures the shape of the spectrum, and the broad absorption at $\sim$8000~\AA, like the single-component equivalent. However, the fit does not capture the continuum at wavelengths $\gtrsim$10,500~\AA~nor $\sim$ 3500 - 5000~\AA. The fit is marginally closer to the observed spectrum at the shortest wavelengths ($\lesssim$ 3500 \AA) but this region lies at the edge of the X-shooter spectrograph sensitivity, and overall the single-component model is favored by visual inspection. 

We infer an outer boundary luminosity of $\log_{10} (L_{\mathrm{outer}}/L_{\odot}) = 7.854^{+0.012}_{-0.017}$. This is brighter than is inferred in the single-component equivalent. This is as expected: due to the use of 30 \TARDIS~iterations (rather than 1), $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$ is updated at each iteration. Hence, in our multi-component models, the meaning of $L_{\mathrm{outer}}$ is different and cannot be mapped directly to $T_{\mathrm{inner}}$. ($L_{\mathrm{outer}}$ is also higher in the 2.4 and 3.4 day multi-component models, compared to the single-component equivalents).

This multi-component run yields two components with substantially different abundance patterns. The first component has a lower electron fraction $Y_{e,1} = 0.139^{+0.028}_{-0.114}$ (and specific entropy $s_1 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 24.6^{+3.4}_{-5.1}$), yielding. The second has higher $Y_{e,2} = 0.340^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$ (and $s_2 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 20.1^{+3.8}_{-3.6}$), distinctly bluer. Indeed, the $Y_{e,2}$ of this second, bluer component is consistent with the single-component fit at 1.4 days. As in the single-component fit, expansion velocities ($v_{\mathrm{exp},1}$ and $v_{\mathrm{exp},2}$) are poorly constrained. Interestingly, the better-constrained entropies ($s_1$ and $s_2$) are both higher than and inconsistent with the single-component equivalent.

However, despite the substantial differences between the two components, one component dominates over the other in producing the emergent spectrum. A physical picture for the components is included in Figure~\ref{fig:infer_multicomp_wedges}. We see that the red component is confined to only 2 shells, while the blue component extends over a greater radius. The mass contained in these two components is $M_{\mathrm{phot},1}/M_{\odot} = 6.9^{+22.1}_{-6.0} \times 10^{-7}$ and $M_{\mathrm{phot},2}/M_{\odot} = 7.0^{+0.8}_{-1.0} \times 10^{-5}$, respectively. We emphasize that this is the mass above the photosphere, and not the total ejecta mass. Nonetheless, the bluer component contains $\sim$100$\times$ as much mass as the redder, and dominates the absorption/emission in the spectrum. In this sense, despite the different compositions of the two components (Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_components_compare}, Appendix~\ref{app:compare_components}), this multi-component \SPARK~run has effectively converged to a single-component model.




%%% subsection 3.2: 2.4 DAYS
\subsection{Single-and multi-component modelling at 2.4 days}\label{ssc:2.4}

In our 2.4 day single-component \SPARK~run, We require $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 600$ points to obtain a good fit and converged posterior (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_single}). The resultant posterior shows some bimodality, most evident in the $s/k_{\mathrm{B}}$ dimension. Discarding samples from the posterior with $s/k_{\mathrm{B}} \geqslant 25.0$, we obtain a superior fit, and use this as our preferred model. This fit captures most of the continuum of the observed spectrum, and most of the $\sim$8000 \AA~absorption. If this absorption belongs to a P Cygni feature (as has been argued in \citealt{watson19, sneppen23}), we partially miss the red wing of this feature. Furthermore, we overestimate the absorption, or underestimate the continuum, at wavelengths $\lesssim$4500 \AA. 

We infer an $\log_{10} (L_{\mathrm{outer}}/L_{\odot}) = 7.594^{+0.040}_{-0.061}$. In the case of single-shell, single-iteration \TARDIS~runs, we can use these values to determine an inner boundary temperature of $T_{\mathrm{inner}} = 3050^{+126}_{-223}~\mathrm{K}$. As expected, the kilonova has dimmed and cooled since the previous epoch. The inferred velocities also match expectations: we obtain inner and outer boundary velocities $v_{\mathrm{inner}}/c = 0.249^{+0.017}_{-0.032}$ and $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.342^{+0.047}_{-0.050}$. This $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$ is consistent with the fixed $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.35c$ from 1.4 days, while $v_{\mathrm{inner}}$ (effectively the photospheric velocity) has receded into the ejecta, compared to $0.31c$ at 1.4 days. This is evidence for the ejecta expanding, cooling, and become optically thinner, as expected.

Finally, we obtain $Y_e = 0.306^{+0.055}_{-0.204}$ and $s/k_{\mathrm{B}} = 17.6^{+7.1}_{-6.3}$. Similar to our results at 1.4 days, $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$ is poorly constrained, while $s$ is better-constrained. This $s$ is also consistent with the previous epoch. The posterior distribution in all dimensions is wider at 2.4 days; in particular, $Y_e$ exhibits a tail extending to smaller electron fractions. The posterior is nonetheless peaked at $Y_e = 0.306^{+0.055}_{-0.204}$, which is slightly lower than at 1.4 days, but consistent to within the uncertainties. 

In our 2.4 day, multi-component \SPARK~run, we require $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 1020$ points to obtain a good fit and converged posterior (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_multi}). The resultant fit once again captures the broad shape and $\sim$8000~\AA~absorption, but the depth of the $\sim$8000~\AA~absorption feature is overestimated. The multi-component fit does, however, achieve a better fit to the continuum at wavelengths $\lesssim$7000~\AA. 

In contrast with the 1.4 day, multi-component run, we see that the two inferred components are remarkably similar. The first component is described by $Y_{e,1} = 0.288^{+0.129}_{-0.187}$ and $s_1 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 21.1^{+10.5}_{-9.5}$, while the latter has $Y_{e,2} = 0.261^{+0.163}_{-0.124}$ and $s_2 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 22.0^{+10.0}_{-10.1}$. Again, expansion velocities are poorly constrained, while the better-constrained entropies are higher than and inconsistent with the single-component equivalent. Both entropies are consistent with the entropies inferred in the 1.4 day, multi-component model. Finally, $Y_{e,1}$ and $Y_{e,2}$ are both lower than, but still consistent with, the dominant blue component in the 1.4 day, multi-component model and the 1.4 day, single-component (purple+warm) model.

Our inferred geometry for the two components is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:infer_multicomp_wedges}. As expected, the photosphere recedes into the ejecta. The two components almost completely overlap in physical space; indeed, the mass contained in these two components is roughly equally split into $M_{\mathrm{phot},1}/M_{\odot} = 2.3^{+12.5}_{-0.7} \times 10^{-5}$ and $M_{\mathrm{phot},2}/M_{\odot} = 4.0^{+4.8}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-5}$, respectively. Furthermore, the similarity between $(Y_{e,1},~v_{\mathrm{exp},1},~s_1)$ and $(Y_{e,2},~v_{\mathrm{exp},2},~s_2)$ yields similar compositions for both components (Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_components_compare}, Appendix~\ref{app:compare_components}). Given the two components' similar compositions and equal contributions to the emergent spectrum, this multi-\SPARK~run has also converged to an effectively single-component model.




%%% subsection 3.3: 3.4 DAYS
\subsection{Single-and multi-component modelling at 3.4 days}\label{ssc:3.4}

Our best single-component model for 3.4 days is in general a poor fit to AT2017gfo. Nonetheless, we review it here for completeness. As at 2.4 days, we require $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 600$ points (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_single}) to obtain a converged posterior. The resultant posterior shows a high degree of multi-modality, most evident in the $\rho_0$, $Y_e$, and $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}$ dimensions. Of the multiple modes, we obtain our best (but still poor) fit with a higher-$\rho_0$, mid-$Y_e$, lower-$s$ mode. This fit produces some, but not all, of the dominant absorption feature at $\sim$8000 \AA. This fit also overestimates the absorption, or underestimates the continuum, for wavelengths $\lesssim$5500 \AA. 

We find $\log_{10} (\rho_0 / \mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}) = -14.586^{+0.313}_{-0.384}$. This density is larger than that inferred at earlier epochs. We also infer $v_{\mathrm{outer}} = 0.309^{+0.032}_{-0.023}$. This $v_{\mathrm{outer}}$ is much smaller than the fixed value at 1.4 days or the inferred at 2.4 days. This may explain the insufficient absorption at $\sim$8000 \AA, if the photon packets are not interacting with enough matter to be absorbed in large numbers before escaping the ejecta. Finally, we find $Y_e = 0.226^{+0.062}_{-0.067}$ and $s/k_{\mathrm{B}} = 15.4^{+7.2}_{-3.1}$ at this epoch. $Y_e$ is lower and inconsistent with both previous epochs. Interestingly, despite the lower $Y_e$, the inferred abundance of Sr is within $1$\% of that of our single-component model at 1.4 days, and in fact $\sim$25\% larger than that of our single-component model at 2.4 days. Nonetheless, Sr does not yield the expected prominent absorption feature at $\sim$8000 \AA. This suggests that the shortcomings of this model may not be due to the inferred abundance pattern, but rather the density, velocity structure, and/or some inherent shortcoming of the single-component model.

For our preferred, multi-component model, we require $m_0 + m_{\mathrm{active}} = 1500 + 1140$ points to obtain a good fit and converged posterior at 3.4 days (see Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_multi}). The resultant fit is better than the single-component equivalent. This fit better captures the $\sim$8000 \AA~absorption, and the red wing of the nominal P Cygni feature. However, this fit also overestimates the absorption, or underestimates the continuum, for wavelengths $\lesssim$5500 \AA. This over/underestimation is more severe than in the single-component model.

Interestingly, we find $\log_{10} (\rho_0 / \mathrm{g~cm^{-3}}) = -14.505^{+0.323}_{-0.372}$, which is higher than, and inconsistent with, the density inferred at 1.4 and 2.4 days. This inconsistency (also present in the disfavored single-component model at 3.4 days) may arise from the emergence of a new component, with a different density profile (either in functional form or in normalization), at this epoch. 

Most significantly, we infer two components with substantially different properties. The first component is described by $Y_{e,1} = 0.228^{+0.073}_{-0.088}$ and $s_1 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 14.9^{+8.0}_{-4.5}$, while the latter has $Y_{e,2} = 0.161^{+0.149}_{-0.104}$ and $s_2 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 21.5^{+8.3}_{-9.5}$. Again, expansion velocities are poorly constrained. Both entropies are better-constrained and consistent with the entropies inferred in the single-component (and multi-component) models at 1.4 and 2.4 days. The $Y_{e,1}$ and $Y_{e,2}$ are both substantially lower than, and inconsistent with, those of the single- and multi-component fits at 1.4 and 2.4 days. This leads to an ejecta that is substantially more lanthanide-rich: The two components have $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan},1} = -0.97^{+0.23}_{-0.32}$ and $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan},2} = -0.88^{+0.32}_{-0.55}$, respectively. This yields a total lanthanide fraction of $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan,total}} = -0.97^{+0.23}_{-0.32}$ (the same as $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan},1}$ after rounding). Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_components_compare} (Appendix~\ref{app:compare_components}) shows the abundances of the two components, with uncertainties. Both components contain some substantial abundance of lanthanides, but the higher-$Y_e$ of the two has $\sim$10$\times$ more of the crucial element Sr.

In Figure~\ref{fig:infer_multicomp_wedges}, we show a physical picture of the inferred ejecta. The photosphere further recedes compared to 1.4 and 2.4 days. Both components mostly overlap in space and the mass is roughly equally split: they have  masses $M_{\mathrm{phot},1}/M_{\odot} = 5.3^{+1.8}_{-1.3} \times 10^{-4}$ and $M_{\mathrm{phot},2}/M_{\odot} = 3.8^{+1.1}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-4}$, respectively. Given the roughly equal contributions from a component rich in lanthanides and another with a similar abundance of lanthanides but $\sim$10$\times$ as much Sr, and the fact that the multi-component model is a substantially better fit than the single-component at 3.4 days, we interpret the ejecta as being genuinely two-component at this epoch. As we will see, the equal contribution from two components with distinct properties shapes the emergent spectrum.

\end{figure}



Thus far, we have selected our favored models by visual inspection, seeing which produces a better fit to the observed spectrum at a given epoch. Here, we explore the physical consistency of our favored models. 

We have found that the 1.4 and 2.4 day spectra are well-fit by a single bluer component. Even when allowed to yield multiple components, the multi-component \SPARK~runs yield effectively single-component best fits at 1.4 and 2.4 days. At 1.4 days, the bluer component contains $\sim$100$\times$ the mass of the redder, and the presence of the red component is thus inconsequential. At 2.4 days, the two components are roughly equal in mass and characterized by similar abundance patterns; this fit is thus also effectively single-component.

In contrast, at 3.4 days, the two components in the multi-component fit have different abundance patterns. In particular, an additional lower-$Y_e$ component rich in lanthanides is required to fit the observed spectrum. The lower-$Y_e$ component contains as much as $\sim$10$\times$ more lanthanides than the higher-$Y_e$ component, given the broadness of the posterior. The remaining higher-$Y_e$ component, however, contains $\sim$10$\times$ as much Sr. Given our atomic data, line list, and (most importantly) abundance patterns from the reaction network calculations of \cite{wanajo18}, no single component is able to simultaneously yield the abundance of Sr and lanthanides needed to reproduce the observed 3.4 day spectrum of AT2017gfo. As we will see in the following sections, the role of the higher-$Y_e$ component is to provide enough Sr to yield the $\sim$8000 \AA~absorption, while the lower-$Y_e$ yields most of the lanthanides needed to produce the short-wavelength $\lesssim$7500 \AA~absorption. 

Aside from asking whether a single- or multi-component ejecta is individually preferred at each epoch, we also ask: does the \textit{addition} of a new component to the original, purple + warm ejecta at 1.4 days improve the fit? To test this, we replace the higher-$Y_e$ components of the multi-component models at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days with this purple + warm component. (These higher-$Y_e$ components have $Y_{e} = $ $ 0.340^{+0.022}_{-0.021}$, $0.288^{+0.129}_{-0.187}$, and $0.228^{+0.073}_{-0.088}$ at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days, respectively). Figure~\ref{fig:swap-purplewarm} shows the spectra which result from replacing these components with the parameters $(Y_e = 0.311,~v_{\mathrm{exp}}/c=0.240,~s / k_{\mathrm{B}}=13.6)$ at each epoch. At all epochs, there is minimal impact on the resultant spectrum and we retain a good fit.  This is not surprising at 1.4 and 2.4 days, where the inferred $Y_e$ is consistent with the purple + warm model. It is, however, surprising at 3.4 days. Crucially, replacing the higher-$Y_e$ component at 3.4 days changes the overall abundance pattern, but the overall abundance of Sr remains unchanged due to the presence of substantial Sr in the purple + warm ejecta. This further suggests that the role of the higher-$Y_e$ component at 3.4 days is primarily to provide enough Sr to produce the $\sim$8000 \AA~absorption, with the lower-$Y_e$ providing sufficient lanthanides. 

Overall, we infer that a new, redder, lanthanide-rich component emerges at 3.4 days. This new red ejecta component has photospheric velocity $0.21c$ and extends out to $0.35c$, suggesting that this component was in fact present at earlier epochs, but was partially buried underneath the photosphere and/or out-shined by the brighter blue component.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disco}

%%% subsection 4.1: ABUNDANCES
\subsection{Abundances of the favored models}\label{ssc:disco-abundances}

Given our favored inferred models, and their best fit ($Y_e$, $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, $s$), we study the inferred abundance pattern of the ejecta as a function of time. We favor the single-component models at 1.4 and 2.4 days, and multi-component model at 3.4 days. We show the abundance patterns of these favored models in Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_time_evolution}. The overall multi-component abundance pattern at 3.4 days is computed as the mass-weighted sum over all shells, including both components. 

The 1.4 and 2.4 day abundance patterns are remarkably similar, but the 2.4 day model has greater uncertainties due to the broader overall posterior. These 2.4 day abundances show evidence for $\sim 10^{-9} - 10^{-6}$ mass fractions for some of the lighter lanthanides. However, as we see in the following section, lanthanides do not leave any clear imprint on the spectrum at 2.4 days. Overall, the 1.4 and 2.4 day spectra are well-described by a single component dominated by light $r$-process elements around the first $r$-process peak.

In contrast, 3.4 day abundance pattern indicates the clear presence of heavier elements and especially lanthanides in the ejecta. The total lanthanide fraction is $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan,total}} = -0.97^{+0.23}_{-0.32}$, several orders of magnitude larger than inferred at 1.4 and 2.4 days. The higher-$Y_e$ component of this multi-component ejecta then provides Sr, the role of which is crucial, as we will see in the the following section. Indeed, we infer abundances of $Y_{\mathrm{Sr},1.4} = 0.069^{+0.021}_{-0.010}$ and $Y_{\mathrm{Sr},2.4} = 0.087^{+0.060}_{-0.020}$ at 1.4 and 2.4 days, and $Y_{\mathrm{Sr},3.4} = 0.067^{+0.035}_{-0.002}$ (mass-weighted sum over all shells, including both components) at 3.4 days. These are remarkably consistent with each other.

The inferred abundance patterns at 1.4 and 2.4 days are markedly non-Solar in Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_time_evolution}, where the Solar $r$-process abundance pattern is taken using the data of \cite{lodders09} with the $s$-process residuals subtracted according to \cite{bisterzo14}. If all NS-NS/BH mergers produced such blue ejecta, this would point to the inability of these mergers to yield the $r$-process abundances seen in several astrophysical settings. The 3.4 day abundance pattern, in contrast, is much closer to Solar up to $Z \sim 80$. In particular, the presence of lanthanides improves this agreement. 

Our abundance results are in broad agreement with inference on the light curves and spectral fitting of AT2017gfo (see \citealt{ji19}, and references therein). While light curve modelling typically uses grey (wavelength-independent) opacities, this modelling generally recovers the emergence of multiple components, including a higher-opacity redder component at $\gtrsim$3 days, as we find here. Our results for lanthanide fractions deviate somewhat from previous works. In particular, previous works find lanthanide fractions $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan}} \sim -6$ to $\sim -4$ for a blue component, and $\sim -2$ for a red component. We find a more lanthanide-poor bluer component, and a marginally more lanthanide-rich ($\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan}} \sim -1$) redder component. This is notable, as \cite{ji19} find that the $\log_{10} X_{\mathrm{lan}} \sim -2$ inferred in previous works falls on the low end of the lanthanide fractions measured in metal-poor stars. If our higher inferred lanthanide fraction is correct, we relieve some of the tension between the lanthanide fractions of the AT2017gfo ejecta and metal-poor stars. However, we caution that we do not probe all of the ejecta, and in particular are not sensitive to the ejecta below the photosphere. This ejecta could be more or less lanthanide-rich, complicating these comparisons.

However, we also see over-absorption from barium (${}_{56}$Ba) at $\sim$4500\AA.  Spectral DEComposition (SDEC) plots in Figure~\ref{fig:SDEC} (Appendix~\ref{app:SDEC}), provide a complementary view of the dominant species.}\label{fig:leaveoneout_pref}
\end{figure}


To assess the impact of different elements on the best fits, we generate leave-one-out spectra. In each, we iteratively leave out a single element by setting its abundance to 0 and transferring that original abundance to a filler element. We use helium (He) as our filler element, since it should not have a marked impact on the emergent spectrum when the ejecta remains optically thick and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) is a valid approximation (\citealt{perego22, tarumi23}).

In Figure~\ref{fig:leaveoneout_pref}, we show leave-one-out spectra for the new favored models at 2.4 and 3.4 days, and the 1.4 day model from \V23. We see the clear imprint of Sr at $\sim$8000 \AA~at all epochs. This is consistent with \cite{watson19, gillanders22, domoto21, domoto22, sneppen23, sneppenwatson23}, which all argue for the importance of Sr in the spectra. In our new model for 2.4 days, we also see some light evidence for absorption from an adjacent first $r$-process peak element, yttrium (${}_{39}$Y), at short wavelengths $\lesssim$4500~\AA. Considering our previous identification of Y at 1.4 days in \V23, this identification at 2.4 days strengthens our previous claim of the importance of Y, and is in agreement with \cite{gillanders22}. Interestingly, Y does not have the same pronounced impact at 3.4 days. This is in agreement with \cite{sneppenwatson23}, which finds that absorption from Y is less prominent at 3.4 days, before a P Cygni feature emerges at $\sim$7600~\AA~at 4.4 and 5.4 days. In our favored multi-component model, the absorption from the lanthanides is much stronger at these (and shorter) wavelengths. 

At 3.4 days, we identify two new, heavier elements: barium (${}_{56}$Ba), an open $s$-shell element in the same periodic table group as Sr, and cerium (${}_{58}$Ce), a lanthanide. Ba is actually responsible for some of the \textit{over}estimated absorption at $\lesssim$5000 \AA. However, recall that we neglect wavelengths $\leqslant$6400 \AA~in our computation of the likelihood at 3.4 days to obtain a fit which accurately captures the Sr absorption. Nonetheless, the omission of Ba improves the fit, suggesting that we overestimate the abundance of Ba in our best fit abundance pattern. The other new element, Ce, produces absorption at $\sim$7000 \AA~which is reprocessed and emitted at $\sim$8000 \AA, and its omission worsens the fit. Ce also introduces some absorption at $\sim$12,000 \AA. Interestingly, this absorption may originate from astrophysically-measured \ion{Ce}{2} lines with rest wavelengths in the range of $\sim$$15,200$ $-$ $16,700$~\AA~(\citealt{cunha17, majewski17}), blueshifted due to the expansion of the ejecta. \cite{domoto21} similarly noted that these \ion{Ce}{2} lines may be prominent in kilonova spectra. The observation of Ce is also consistent with the kilonova parameter space clustering analysis of \cite{ford23}, which finds that \ion{Ce}{2} may broadly be an important ion in kilonova spectra from 1.4 to 3.4 days. \ion{Ce}{3} may also be important at later epochs (\citealt{gillanders23}). 

We complement these leave-one-out analyses using the Spectral DEComposition (SDEC) tool of \TARDIS. SDEC allows us to measure which elements or ions absorb and/or emit the greatest luminosity during a given \TARDIS~run. All SDEC plots, for favored and disfavored models, are compiled in Figure~\ref{fig:SDEC} (Appendix~\ref{app:SDEC}). In both models at 1.4 days, we see that the absorption of photon packets is dominated by just three singly-ionized species: \ion{Sr}{2}, \ion{Y}{2}, and \ion{Zr}{2}. Indeed, 98.9\% of all absorbed luminosity is absorbed by just these three species in the favored single-component model. These ions remain important at 2.4 days, though the impact of \ion{Zr}{2} is less clear. We also see some minor absorption from \ion{Ba}{2} at 2.4 days, at the shortest wavelengths.

At 3.4 days, while \ion{Sr}{2} remains important, the SDEC plots reveal the presence of several new heavier ions. In the favored multi-component model, we see clearer evidence for \ion{Ba}{2}, with the caveat that the abundance of Ba is likely overestimated. More interesting, we see absorption from four singly-ionized lanthanides: \ion{Ce}{2}, \ion{Nd}{2}, \ion{Sm}{2}, and \ion{Eu}{2} (cerium, ${}_{58}$Ce; neodymium, ${}_{60}$Nd; samarium, ${}_{62}$Sm; europium, ${}_{63}$Eu). The absorption from Ce is strongest. Altogether, \ion{Ce}{2} is responsible for 27.5\% of the absorbed luminosity at this epoch, compared to 20.4\% from \ion{Nd}{2} + \ion{Sm}{2} + \ion{Eu}{2}, and 30.3\% from \ion{Sr}{2}. This is a clear indication of the presence of lanthanides in the ejecta. Interestingly, Eu is a ``pure'' $r$-process element, in that it is produced in negligible quantities by the $s$-process (\textit{e.g.}, \citealt{bisterzo14}). The presence of Eu is thus further proof for the operation of the $r$-process in NS-NS merger ejecta. Finally, at 3.4 days, we also see some light (5.2\% of the total) absorption from an ion of bismuth (${}_{83}$Bi), \ion{Bi}{2}. This is the heaviest element detected in any of our models, but we caution that its detection is marginal (we measure $Y_{\mathrm{Bi},3.4} = 7.84^{+24.6}_{-7.43} \times 10^{-6}$), and it does not leave a clear imprint on the leave-one-out spectra. 

Considering both the leave-one-out and SDEC analyses, we confidently identify Sr at all epochs. We solidify our identification of Y at 1.4 and 2.4 days. Ba may also be present in the ejecta, but its abundance is likely overestimated at 3.4 days, complicating this claim. Finally, at 3.4 days, we infer the presence of singly-ionized species of the lanthanides Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, with the detection of Ce being most concrete. This ensemble of lanthanides, which was not present at 1.4 and 2.4 days, emerges at 3.4 days to significantly shape the emergent spectrum. 




%%% subsection 4.3: PHYSICAL ORIGIN OF EJECTA COMPONENTS
\subsection{Physical origin of the ejecta components}\label{ssc:disco-origins}

Inferring the parameters of the ejecta component(s) also allows us to map these components to different ejection mechanisms in the NS-NS merger which generated the kilonova. Given the inferred $Y_e$ and $s$ (we neglect $v_{\mathrm{exp}}$, since it is poorly constrained), the ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days can be attributed to matter that has undergone strong neutrino reprocessing. This ejecta can arise from the neutrino-reprocessed wind of a hypermassive neutron star remnant plus disk, either magnetized (\eg, \citealt{combi23,curtis23b}) or unmagnetized (\eg, \citealt{fujibayashi23,just23}). Alternatively, accretion disks around black holes---evolved in MHD---also yield ejecta with a broad distribution of electron fractions (\eg, \citealt{siegel18, fernandez19, christie19, miller19, just22, fahlman22, hayashi23, curtis23a}). An outflow from such an accretion disk could in principle provide both the ejecta at 1.4 and 2.4 days, and, the neutron-rich component which emerges at 3.4 days. 
 
The lanthanide-bearing component at 3.4 days ($Y_{e,2} = 0.161^{+0.149}_{-0.104}$, $s_2 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 21.5^{+8.3}_{-9.5}$) can also be accounted for by dynamical ejecta. Numerical relativity simulations that include neutrino absorption typically find $Y_e \sim 0.15 - 0.25$ and $s / k_{\mathrm{B}} \sim 20$ (\eg, \citealt{zappa23}), consistent with our inferred  parameters. The slightly higher-$Y_e$ component at 3.4 days ($Y_{e,1} = 0.228^{+0.073}_{-0.088}$, $s_1 / k_{\mathrm{B}} = 14.9^{+8.0}_{-4.5}$) is also consistent with such dynamical ejecta. However, the dynamical ejecta alone is unlikely to account for most of the mass generating the kilonova, as numerical relativity simulations {that employ parameters consistent with GW170817 produce $\lesssim 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$ in this dynamical component (\eg, \citealt{shibata17, most19, nedora21}). Our inferred masses $M_{\mathrm{phot},1} \sim M_{\mathrm{phot},2} \sim 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$ are consistent with this bound, but recall that we are only sensitive to the mass above the photosphere. Moreover, light curve modelling has found that more mass is contained in the red than the blue component, which is challenging to accomplish if our red component is indeed dynamical ejecta. Modelling the later spectra of AT2017gfo, when we are sensitive to more of the ejecta mass, will be important for understanding whether this new, redder, lanthanide-rich component is more consistent with dynamical ejecta or an outflow from an accretion disk.

%% CONCLUSIONS %%
\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conco}

We fit single- and multi-component ejecta models to the spectra of the GW170817 kilonova, AT2017gfo, during the early, optically thick phase at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days post-merger. With these fits, we infer the element-by-element abundance patterns at each of these epochs. We find that a single-component model is favored at 1.4 and 2.4 days, while a multi-component model is favored at 3.4 days. 

This single component at 1.4 and 2.4 days is characterized by a high electron fraction $Y_e \sim 0.3$ and moderate specific entropy $s / k_{\mathrm{B}} \sim 13 - 18$, yielding an ejecta dominated by lighter $r$-process elements and a blue kilonova. This ejecta is consistent with material which has undergone substantial neutrino reprocessing, \eg, winds from a remnant hypermassive neutron star and/or an accretion disk. The multi-component ejecta at 3.4 days contains a higher $Y_e \sim 0.23$ component and lower $Y_e \sim 0.16$ component, with entropies in the range $s / k_{\mathrm{B}}\sim 15 - 22$. These new components contain heavier elements, and especially the lanthanides, yielding a redder kilonova. The most substantial contribution of lanthanides comes from the lower-$Y_e$ component, which is consistent with either dynamical ejecta or a neutron-rich outflow from a remnant accretion disk. 

The emergence of a new red component at 3.4 days is broadly in agreement with modelling of the light curves of AT2017gfo. Physically, we infer that the photosphere recedes into the ejecta over time: from $0.31c$ at 1.4 days, to $0.25c$ at 2.4 days, to $0.21c$ at 3.4 days. This recession of the photosphere, and the dimming of the earlier, blue component, reveals this new red component that was not inferred at earlier epochs. 

Using both leave-one-out and Spectral DEComposition analyses, we assess the contributions of individual elements to the emergent spectra. We find that strontium Sr produces the $\sim$8000~\AA~absorption at each epoch. We also strengthen our identification of yttrium Y at short wavelengths $\lesssim$4500~\AA~at 1.4 and 2.4 days. At 3.4 days, this absorption from Y is less clear, as absorption from an ensemble of lanthanides (cerium Ce, neodymium Nd, samarium Sm, and europium Eu) dominates the absorption at these short wavelengths. The identification of Ce is most concrete, producing absorption at $\sim$7000~\AA~and $\sim$12,000~\AA.

The abundance patterns at 1.4 and 2.4 days show a dearth of lanthanides and heavier elements which makes these inconsistent with the Solar $r$-process abundance pattern. However, at 3.4 days, the emergence of ejecta with lanthanide fraction $X_{\mathrm{lan}} \sim -1$~substantially improves the agreement between the inferred abundance pattern and the Solar $r$-process, and the distribution of lanthanide fractions measured in metal-poor stars. The better agreement between the Solar $r$-process/metal-poor stars and inferred abundance pattern at 3.4 days, and the possible presence of multiple components (remnant/disk wind and dynamical ejecta), lends more credence to the ability of NS-NS/BH mergers to dominate the $r$-process in the Universe. 

While we have fit spectra of AT2017gfo at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days, the observed spectra of AT2017gfo extend to 10.4 days. At later times, the ejecta is expected to leave the photospheric phase and enter the optically-thin nebular phase, when non-LTE effects become non-negligible. Given the modular nature of \SPARK, we could swap out \TARDIS~for a code specifically suited to non-LTE radiative transfer, or, use the non-LTE functionality already available in \TARDIS. Our Bayesian inference framework would also enable quantitative model comparison between models with and without non-LTE effects at epochs where their relative importance is not yet understood (\eg, 4.4 and 5.4 days). Fitting later epochs will also be crucial for inferring the abundances and masses of all of the ejecta components, including those hidden below the photosphere at 3.4 days. Beyond the later epochs of AT2017gfo, \SPARK~can perform inference on the growing zoo of kilonova yielded by NS-NS/BH binaries with different parameters, allowing us to understand the connections between binary parameters, ejection mechanisms, elemental compositions, and fundamental $r$-process conditions in the ejecta.

\section{All Training Spectra \& Posteriors}\label{app:allspec_posteriors}

Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_single} shows all of the spectra used to construct the training sets in the single-component \SPARK~runs at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days post-merger. Figure~\ref{fig:all_spec_multi} shows the same for the multi-component equivalents. These include the $m_0 = 1500$ Latin Hypercube Samples, $m_{\mathrm{active}}$ active learning samples, and the best fit spectrum, for each.

Posterior probabilities are computed for each of these spectra, and these are used by the Gaussian Process to construct a surrogate posterior. All posteriors are obtained through dynamic nested sampling of the surrogate Gaussian Process using \texttt{dynesty} (\citealt{speagle20}). Figures \ref{fig:corner_single_2.4}~and \ref{fig:corner_single_3.4} show the full posteriors for the new single-component fits to the 2.4 and 3.4 day spectra, respectively. Both posteriors are multi-modal. We highlight the modes which correspond to the best fits in Table~\ref{tab:bestfit_single}. Figures~\ref{fig:corner_multi_1.4}, \ref{fig:corner_multi_2.4}, and~\ref{fig:corner_multi_3.4} show the full posteriors for the new multi-component fits to the 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 day spectra, respectively. The medians of these posteriors are given as the best fit parameters in Table~\ref{tab:bestfit_multi}.

The red component at 1.4 days has $\sim$100$\times$ less mass than the blue and its contribution to the emergent spectrum is negligible, despite having a substantially different abundance pattern.

Figure~\ref{fig:abunds_components_compare} compares the abundances of each component in the multi-component models at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days. The abundance patterns for the two components are highly similar at 2.4 days. At 3.4 days, there is a lower-$Y_e$ component with more lanthanides and a relative dearth of Sr, while the higher-$Y_e$ component contains $\sim$10$\times$ as much Sr. Crucially, these are abundances, not mass fractions: while the components are approximately equipartitioned in mass at 2.4 and 3.4 days, at 1.4 days, the blue has $\sim$100$\times$ the mass of the red such that the red has negligible impact on the emergent spectrum.

%% SDEC %%
\section{Spectral DEComposition Plots}\label{app:SDEC}

Figure~\ref{fig:SDEC} shows the Spectral DEComposition (SDEC) plots for all 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 day single- and multi-component fits. These SDEC plots show the species (elements or ions) which dominate the absorption (measured by absorbed luminosity) and emission (measured by emitted luminosity) in the spectrum. Above the horizontal axis, the height of the histogram indicates the total emitted luminosity in some wavelength bin, across different species. Below the horizontal axis, the depth of the histogram indicates the total absorbed luminosity. These plots also show how emission may be reprocessed, \ie, absorbed in some wavelength range and re-emitted in another. These are complementary to leave-one-out plots (Figure~\ref{fig:leaveoneout_pref}), which highlight the elements that have the largest impact on the shape of the spectrum, in terms of either absorption or emission.

    \figcaption{\textbf{Spectral DEComposition (SDEC) plots for all best fits, at 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days, for single- and multi-component models}. The left column contains single-component models for 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 days; the right contains multi-component equivalents. The ions \ion{Sr}{2}, \ion{Y}{2}, and \ion{Zr}{2} produce significant absorption in all 1.4 day and 2.4 day models. The 2.4 day models also show absorption from \ion{Ba}{2}. The 3.4 day single-component model (which is a poor fit to the observed spectrum, but nonetheless the best fit possible with a single component) exhibits absorption from all four of these ions, except \ion{Zr}{1} in the place of \ion{Zr}{2}, due to the cooler ejecta. The spectrum also shows moderate absorption from ions of three lanthanides: \ion{La}{2}, \ion{Ce}{2}, and \ion{Nd}{2}. The 3.4 multi-component model, which is favored over the single-component, shows absorption from two open $s$-shell elements in the same periodic table group (\ion{Sr}{2} and \ion{Ba}{2}), four lanthanide ions (\ion{Ce}{2}, \ion{Nd}{2}, \ion{Sm}{2}, and \ion{Eu}{2}), and one ion of an especially heavy element, \ion{Bi}{2}. Furthermore, unlike at earlier epochs, ions of Y and Zr do not dominate absorption in the 3.4 day multi-component model.}\label{fig:SDEC}
